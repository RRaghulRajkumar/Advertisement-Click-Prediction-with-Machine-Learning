# 📈 Advertisement Click Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

In this exciting project, we delved into the world of advertising data and unleashed the power of machine learning to develop an algorithm that predicts whether a user will click on a specific advertisement. Our journey was filled with data exploration, feature engineering, statistical tests, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

## Key Highlights 🌟

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We embarked on a data adventure, peering into the depths of our advertising dataset. EDA provided us with the map to navigate through data's terrain, revealing hidden treasures like distribution patterns and potential correlations.

- **Feature Engineering:** We donned our engineer hats to craft new features that turbocharged our machine learning models. These features transformed the data landscape, enhancing our predictive abilities.

- **Data Visualization 📊:** Armed with colorful palettes and graphing tools, we painted a vivid picture of the data. Our visualizations included histograms, scatter plots, and dazzling correlation matrices, uncovering precious gems of knowledge within the data.

- **Statistical Tests 🔬:** We turned to science to validate our discoveries. Tests for normality ensured that our data met the prerequisites for machine learning. The Mann-Whitney U test allowed us to compare two groups, unraveling statistical insights.

- **Machine Learning Models 🤖:** We enlisted the power of two loyal companions, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to build predictive models. These models underwent rigorous training, arming us with the ability to foresee whether a user would embark on an ad-clicking journey.

- **Python 🐍:** Our trusty companion in this expedition was the Python programming language. With its arsenal of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, we forged ahead in our quest.

## Results and Scores 🚀

- Our trusty steed, the Random Forest Classifier, achieved a resounding **96.62%** cross-validated score, setting a high standard in predicting ad clicks.

- Its accuracy on the training set stood at a remarkable **99.4%**, a testament to its unwavering loyalty and performance.

- The Logistic Regression model, another reliable ally, showcased its mettle with an impressive **99.2%** training set accuracy.

- The Logistic Regression Classifier delivered a **95.62%** cross-validated score, proving its worth in the prediction battlefield.
